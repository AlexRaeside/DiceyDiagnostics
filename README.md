# DiceyDiagnostics

My little python project where I mess around with 
both dash apps and also dice to demonstrate basic 
concepts around Bayesian inference, precision and recall and stuff like 
that. Eventually this project will include seaborn graphs, a Dash app and something 
to do with SQLs and RestAPIs. It really is just meant as a messaround.
